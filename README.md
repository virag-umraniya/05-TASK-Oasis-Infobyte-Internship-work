Sales Prediction using Python Developed a predictive model for sales forecasting using historical data. Applied machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict future sales trends. Utilized libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data processing and model evaluation.

# Sales Prediction Using Python - Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my Data Science internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The objective was to build a machine learning model that predicts future sales using historical sales data. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict future sales based on historical data to help businesses forecast demand, optimize inventory, and make data-driven decisions.

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the historical sales data and cleaned it by handling missing values and outliers.
   - Performed feature engineering to create relevant predictors for sales forecasting.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized sales trends, seasonal patterns, and relationships with various features.
   - Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

3. **Model Building**
   - Split the data into training and test sets.
   - Built and evaluated various machine learning models, including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate and compare the models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Outcome
The project successfully predicted future sales with a high degree of accuracy using various machine learning models. It provided valuable insights into sales trends, helping businesses make informed decisions.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from real-world sales data, including features like date, sales volume, price, and more.
